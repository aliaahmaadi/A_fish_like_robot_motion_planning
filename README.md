# A_fish_like_robot_motion_planning
A project for control and motion planning of a nonholonomic robot while avoiding obstacles 

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a trajectory planning and control system for a non-holonomic mobile platform. The platform autonomously moves from point A to point B while avoiding obstacles in between, based on optimization-based techniques for cost function minimization.

## Objectives
- Design and implementing a controller as well a motion planning algorithm.
- Test the effectiveness and accuracy of the system in a simulation environment.

## Simulation Setup
This project is implemented using **MATLAB/Simulink 2023b**. You can run the simulation by executing the `motion_p2_obstacle_avoidance_with_plots.m` script in the `code/` folder.

## Results
The results of the simulation, including trajectories, control inputs, and performance metrics, are stored in the `results/` folder.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aliaahmaadi/Nonholonomic-Platform-Trajectory-Planning.git
